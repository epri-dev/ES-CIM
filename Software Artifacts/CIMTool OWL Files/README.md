These OWL files are used to rebuild each messaging profile in [CIMTool](https://github.com/CIMug-org/CIMTool). To import, create a new project in CIMTool and when choosing a file to import, select these OWL files instead of the other options (e.g. .eapx or .xmi). These only contain information for the profile and not the entire Common Information Model, thus only allowing further restricting of a profile and not extension. More information on how to use CIMTool can be found through the [CIMUG](https://cimug.ucaiug.org/Meetings/Oslo2014/Supporting%20Documents/CIM%20University/11-Using%20CIMTool.pdf) or EPRI's [CIM Primer](https://www.epri.com/research/products/000000003002021840).
