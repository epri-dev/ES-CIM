# Coco Image Extensions
## Directory
- **ImageAnnotations**
- **ImageInfo**
- **ImageLicenses**
- **Images**

This directory contains various profiles dealing with the CIMified version of the CoCo Image Annotation format. Like CoCo itself, the artifacts for this are designed for use with JSON specifically, so there will be no SOAP-related artifacts (e.g. WSDLs and XSDs) for these extensions.
