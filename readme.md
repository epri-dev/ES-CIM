The Energy Supply Common Information Model (ES-CIM) is an extension of the IEC CIM. This repository contains software artifacts developed from the ES-CIM extension (WSDL, XSD, JSON, XML) currently maintained by EPRI to aid the general public in in developing interfaces with information systems that support bulk energy supply assets.

Interfaces developed in the following areas:

- [Heat Transfer](Software%20Artifacts/Heat_Transfer)
- [CoCo] (Software%20Artifacts/Coco)
- [Maintenance Orders](Software%20Artifacts/Maintenance_Orders)
- [Water Chemistry](Software%20Artifacts/Water_Chemistry)
- [Radiation](Software%20Artifacts/Radiation)
- [Spectroscopy](Software%20Artifacts/Spectroscopy)  

In addition, the ES-CIM has been extended to support the development of profiles that are consistent with the Common Objects in Context (CoCo) standard which is used to support AI+ML use cases. These extensions have been reviewed by UCAIUG subject matter experts and are slated to appear in the next CIM release.
