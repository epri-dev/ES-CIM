The Energy Supply Common Information Model (ES-CIM) is an extension of the IEC CIM. This repository contains software artifacts developed from the ES-CIM extension (WSDL, XSD, JSON, XML) currently maintained by [EPRI](https://epri.com) to aid the general public in in developing interfaces with information systems that support bulk energy supply assets.

Interfaces developed in the following areas:
* [Heat Transfer](Software%20Artifacts/Heat_Transfer)
* [Maintenance Orders](Software%20Artifacts/Maintenance_Orders)
* [Water Chemistry](Software%20Artifacts/Water_Chemistry)

More information and background is available in the latest EPRI report on the subject [3002018431 - Power Generation Common Information Model: 2020 Integration Experiences and Roadmap for Integration](https://www.epri.com/research/products/000000003002018431)
